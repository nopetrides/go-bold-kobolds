    m_Localized: <b><kr>Queen's General:</kr></b>\n Jack of all trades, master of
      none. These kobolds are the mainstay of the forces. With no supernatural gift,
      the average kobold must use wit and teamwork to overcome obstacles.

      magic, these sorcerers wield the arcane against their foes. Their attunement
      to magic makes them excentric and may disturb other kobolds.

      with inheriting the wings of true dragons. Known as <i>"Urds"</i> They are
      held in high esteem as a sign of favor with the Dragon Lords, but the attention

      reponsibilities of protecting the most important things to the tribe: the hatchery,
      and the treasurey. They''re still kobolds though, so they are pretty bad at
      the job.'
